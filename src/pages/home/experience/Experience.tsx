                Nowadays, I mainly focus on doing full stack web development. I have
                done a lot of work using React w/ hooks and have experience in the
                Next.js framework to leverage server-side rendering with React Server
                Components. For back-end work, Iâ€™ve spent a lot of time in Java with
                Spring, and some time in Ruby on Rails.
